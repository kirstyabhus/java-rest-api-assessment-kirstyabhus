# Investment Portfolio Manager API 
## Description
Welcome to the Investment Portfolio Manager API, a robust backend system powered by Spring Boot. This API serves as a comprehensive solution for efficiently managing diverse investment portfolios comprising stocks and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Seamlessly handling multiple portfolios, this platform allows users to create, update, and oversee various investment portfolios, ensuring optimal control and management of investment assets. Additionally, the API introduces sustainability ratings, providing insights into the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of individual investments. By leveraging sustainability ratings, users can assess the sustainable impact of their investment decisions, facilitating informed and responsible portfolio management.

## Documentation
The API documentation, powered by SpringDoc and Swagger, provides comprehensive insights into the functionalities of this application. Access the documentation at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html while the application is running. Please note that accessing the documentation with this link requires the application to be active on port 8080. However, this can be changed with the addition of the line `server.port="your desired port number"` in the application.properties file.

The Swagger API documentation serves as a detailed guide showcasing available endpoints, their usage, request parameters, response formats, and error codes. It offers a user-friendly interface to explore and understand the API functionalities efficiently.

Ensure the application is running on port 8080 to fully leverage the rich documentation provided by Swagger, facilitating a smoother understanding and utilization of the API's capabilities.

## Project Structure
- `controllers` : Contains classes responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, interacting with services, processing data, and forming appropriate HTTP responses. 
- `services` : holds classes that encapsulate business logic or application-specific functionality. They perform operations requested by controllers, interact with repositories for data access, perform computations, and implement the core logic of the application.
- `repositories` :  Contains classes responsible for data access. They interact with the underlying data storage (JSON file). CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed here and an abstraction layer is provided for data access.
- `model` : Contains classes that represent the data entities. These classes define the structure of the data used within the application.
- `utility` : Contains functions for handling JSON data (reading and writing).
- `exceptions` : Used to hold custom exception classes or exception-related functionalities

### Data flow
`Users API request` > `Controller` > `Service` > `Repository` > `Utility` > `Repository` > `Service` > `Controller` > `User API response`

## Technology Used
- Java and Spring Boot: Used to create the application
- RESTful API: To handle the CRUD operations on the portfolios and investments
- JSON: Used to store portfolio data
- HashMap/List: JSON data was retrieved into a HashMap to store portfolios/investments and in Lists in order to perform CRUD and other operations.
- JUnit and Mockito: Used to test the API
- Maven: Used to manage the dependencies of the application

## Prerequisites
- JDK 17 or higher must be installed.
- Apache Maven 3.6 or newer.

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot: Used to develop a java-based, standalone, Spring-based application
- GSON: Used for JSON serialization and deserialization.
- SpringFox Swagger UI: Used to generate interactive API documentation, allowing API calls to be used directly in the browser.
